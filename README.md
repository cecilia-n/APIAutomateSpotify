This is a learning project to understand the RESTFUL API architecture and how to interact with APIs.



Long-term Lessons Learned:

-Always Read Documentation

-Find out which basic foundational knowledge is needed before starting and understand (Google Well)

-Create similar 'projects' in own version demonstrating the over-arching concept

-You can import functions of another python file to the current one (Breaking Code apart in Sections Easier to Read esp in Github)

-DEBUG, DEBUG, DEBUG (print statements, different parameters, test cases, etc.)
